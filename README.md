# Simple CLI

## Steps to Setup/Run (Windows)

`npm i`

`npx nx build`

`node .\dist\simple-cli\main.js PATH_TO_REPO NAME_OF_FOLDER`

- `PATH_TO_REPO`: Full path to the repo you have cloned locally (ie: **c:\repos\ngx-mask**)
- `NAME_OF_FOLDER`: Name of the folder you want to list contributors for (ie: **packages**)

#### I would normally break this out better, and write more tests, but I wanted to keep it true to the ~2 hours mark. I know this is a test about not only efficiency, but also quality, and I wanted to show that I can get something done quickly, and then iterate on it to make it better. I also tried to keep everything in one file, for simplicity and readability.

#### I wanted to do the react app, but I work primarily in angular, and do not have a lot of react experience. If you're interested in seeing some work I've done very recently in angular (ng, primeng, ngrx, nestjs), I'd be happy to provide that!

#### Thanks for your time, and, if you find this acceptable, I look forward to hearing from you!
